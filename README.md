# Final project for the Building AI course




## Summary

An app for ad hoc travellers who wants to choose their vacay destination from places where the sun is shining. Briefly - app shows a weather forecast and when you choose the city, you'll see e.g. available acoomodations, upcoming events (e.g. concerts, sport events) and public transportation options. You can book your trip via this app. 




## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

During this pandemic Finnish people have made a lot of small trips in Finland where they have browsed our beautiful country. 

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.




## How is it used?

Everything should work through an app. User interface needs to be easy to use, not too many choises, ads, etc. since the target group will be local ad hoc travellers. 




## Data sources and AI methods

Data for this app comes from different places: 

1. a weather forecast from e.g. FMI or Foreca
2. Available accommodation data from e.g. Booking.com, Hotels.com
3. Upcoming events from e.g. municipalities webpages, meteli.net
4. Transportation options from VR, Finnair, etc.




## Challenges

As this would be an app which gatheres data from other platforms, it needs to be integrated to them. I don't know if it is possible.. and I don't know if someone already has done a similar app. 




## What next?

To be honest, I know nothing about coding, my strengths are on the commercial side. If someone thinks that this would be a good project to move forward, feel free to contact us- I'll be happy to discuss this further.
