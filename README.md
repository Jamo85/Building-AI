# Final project for the Building AI course




## Summary

An app for ad hoc travellers who wants to choose their vacay destination from places where the sun is shining. Briefly - app shows a weather forecast and when you choose the city, you'll see e.g. available acoomodations, upcoming events (e.g. concerts, sport events) and public transportation options. You can book your trip via this app. 




## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.




## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?




## Data sources and AI methods

Data for this app comes from different places: 

1. a weather forecast from e.g. FMI or Foreca
2. Available accommodation data from e.g. Booking.com, Hotels.com
3. Upcoming events from e.g. municipalities webpages, meteli.net
4. Transportation options from VR, Finnair, etc.




## Challenges

As this would be a platform which gatheres data from other platforms, it needs to be integrated to them. I don't know if that is possible or not.  




## What next?

To be honest, I know nothing about coding, my strengths are on the commercial side. If someone thinks that this would be a good project to move forward, feel free to contact us- I'll be happy to discuss this further.
