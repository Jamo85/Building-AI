# Final project for the Building AI course




## Summary

An app for ad hoc travellers who wants to choose their vacay destination from places where the sun is shining. Briefly - app shows a weather forecast and when you choose the city, you'll see available acoomodations, upcoming events (e.g. concerts, sport events) and public transportation options as well. You can book your trip via this app. 




## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.




## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?




## Data sources and AI methods

Data for this app comes from different places: 

1. a weather forecast from e.g. FMI or Foreca
2. Available accommodation data from e.g. Booking.com, Hotels.com
3. Upcoming events from e.g. municipalities webpages, meteli.net


Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |




## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?




## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 

To be honest, I don't know nothing about coding. I'm more commercial-oriented person. If someone thinks that this would be a good idea or project to move on, and not so difficult to do, please contact.
